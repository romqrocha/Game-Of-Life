# Game Of Life
<p>A more colourful take on Conway's Game of Life.</p>
<p>To start, run the Main.java class.</p>
<p>This project has two versions. Version A was coded before knowing the requirements 
of Version B. This was a way to encourage decoupling the code and make it as easy 
as possible to make changes to its classes in the future.</p>
<p>The end result was, from my perspective, a well-designed program that takes full 
advantage of OOP practices.</p>
